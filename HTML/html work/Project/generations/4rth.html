    <h3>The main characteristics of fourth generation of computers (1970s-present)</h3>
  <p>electronic component very large-scale integration (VLSI) and microprocessor.</p>
  <p>VLSI thousands of transistors on a single microchip.</p>
  <p>Memory semiconductor memory (such as RAM, ROM, etc.)</p>
  <p>RAM (random-access memory) a type of data storage (memory element) used in computers that temporary stores of programs and data (volatile: its contents are lost when the computer is turned off).</p>
  <p>ROM (read-only memory) a type of data storage used in computers that permanently stores data and programs (non-volatile: its contents are retained even when the computer is turned off).</p>
  <p>Programming language high level language (Python, C#, Java, JavaScript, Rust, Kotlin, etc.).</p>
  <p>A mix of both third- and fourth-generation languages</p>
  <p>Size smaller, cheaper and more efficient than third generation computers.</p>
  <p>Speed improvement of speed, accuracy, and reliability (in comparison with the third generation computers).</p>
  <p>Input / output devices keyboard, pointing devices, optical scanning, monitor, printer, etc.</p>
  <p>Network a group of two or more computer systems linked together.</p>
  <p>Examples IBM PC, STAR 1000, APPLE II, Apple Macintosh, etc.</p>
